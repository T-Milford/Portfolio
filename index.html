        <!-- <p>Ever since that day at the mall where I first discovered Mario Brothers, 
        I have always loved technology.  As a gamer, teacher, and musician, I have benefited enormously 
        from the opportunities technology has ushered into each of these areas - especially in the 
        last decade with the advent of the smart phone.  </p> -->

            Being a web developer allows me to bring together the problem-solving that has characterized 
            my life as a teacher 
            <!-- (and, arguably, as a gamer)  -->
            with the creativity found in my life as a musician. </p>
            <!-- Mouse hover on above (perhaps the word "musician") pushes content down to reveal below?  -->
                <p class="middle_p"> It is deeply fulfilling to bring something to life from the ground up that is functionally 
                and aesthetically beautiful.</p>
                <!-- .  Just like composing a piece of music, each bit of code must work 
                in concert with all of the others to create something greater than the sum of their parts.</p> -->

<p>Aside from teaching, gaming, and writing/listening to music, I love to read, spend time with my wife and 
     daughter, and drink coffee.  Also...
     <!-- mouse-hover over "Also..." to push content down and add the text below?  -->
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>I have published two solo albums (both available on Spotify).  The most recent album, recorded 
                with members of the Phoenix Symphony, was named one of the best local Phoenix albums of 2015.</li>  
            <li>I also have a MS from ASU in Biology and have published and defended two theses, one of which
                at the graduate level.</li>
